ðŸ”— Concept of Linked Lists and Their Applications in Algorithm Design

 What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are stored in memory in a non-contiguous way. Each node contains:

Data: the actual value

Pointer (or reference): to the next node in the list

Types of linked lists:

Singly Linked List: Nodes point to the next node only.

Doubly Linked List: Nodes have references to both next and previous nodes.

Circular Linked List: The last node connects back to the first node.

 Why Use Linked Lists?

Dynamic Size: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require predefined size and can grow/shrink dynamically.

Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Inserting or deleting nodes (especially at the beginning or middle) is faster compared to arrays.

Memory Efficiency: They avoid memory reallocation since they don't require contiguous memory.

ðŸ”§ Applications in Algorithm Design

Stacks and Queues: Can be implemented using linked lists for efficient dynamic memory use.

Graph Representations: Adjacency lists for graphs are often built using linked lists.

Polynomial Arithmetic: Linked lists represent polynomials for easy term-wise addition or multiplication.

Hash Tables with Chaining: Collision handling using linked lists (separate chaining).

Memory Management: Used in operating systems for free memory block tracking.
