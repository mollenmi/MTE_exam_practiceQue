##  Histogram Problems: Concept & Applications

### üîç What is a Histogram Problem?
In algorithm design, the histogram problem typically refers to the **"Largest Rectangle in a Histogram"** problem. You are given an array where each element represents the height of a bar in a histogram. The goal is to find the **area of the largest rectangle** that can be formed using adjacent bars.

###  Core Idea
- You need to find the **maximum rectangular area** that can fit inside the histogram.
- Each rectangle can only span **consecutive bars**.
- The height of the rectangle is limited by the **shortest bar** in the chosen range.

###  Example
Given heights: `[2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]`

- The largest rectangle has an area of **10** (formed by bars 5 and 6 ‚Üí width = 2, height = 5).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Algorithm: Stack-Based Approach
To solve this efficiently in **O(n)** time:

1. Use a **stack** to keep track of bar indices.
2. When a **shorter bar** is found, pop from the stack and calculate the area.
3. Keep track of the **maximum area** encountered.

### üßπ Applications in Algorithm Design

#### Dynamic Programming
- Used in matrix-based problems like **finding the largest rectangle of 1's** in a binary matrix.

#### Text and Image Processing
- Histograms are used in **pattern matching** and **image histogram analysis**.

#### Histogram Area Problems
- Helps in **layout design** (e.g., arranging widgets in UI design).
- Useful in **CPU/GPU load visualization** and **space management**.

#### Real-Time Data Visualization
- **Bar chart optimization** and **bounding box computation** in dashboards and visualizations.

###  Time and  Space Complexity (Stack-Based Solution)
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack
